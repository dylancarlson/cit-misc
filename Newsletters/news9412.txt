              Section I
              Back in the 80's there was a software made that was called
              citadel, I'm kind of hazy on who made the first citadel 
              whether it was Hue Jr. or Orc or who. But I do know that in 
              1987 there was a kind soul who decided that boards running
              this type of software and it's variants needed a newsletter
              this man's name was Steve Yelvington. He wrote the first 7
              issues of the citanews, it was continued for one issue by
              David Quick, Eric Griff, Dominic Duvall and Bill.K. But in 
              April of 1993 Bill.K finished the last citanews and no one
              decided to carry on the tradition. So here I am I who knows
              little of cita-history carrying on the torch a Year and a half
              later. I've tried my very best to get articles that I believe
              you will enjoy. Because all citadellians deserve a citanews. 
              <wipes tear from eyes>

             


      Section II
      Who is this Psychotic Killer guy?

       He's the one who is composing this newsletter. 

      Why?
      Because he likes citadels ok! But more importantly he wants to keep
      the citadel tradition alive. PK is better known as Mike Jones, he 
      runs a Fortress-PC (Stadel-PC variant) in Salt Lake City Utah
      (the number is 1-801-278-0565). Ok time to stop referring to myself
      in the 3rd person. I'll tell you my cita-story. I first logged on to
      The Only BBS out in salt lake, it was a fnordadel and it was different
      than those WWIV's I tried, the first thing I did was complain about the
      lack of games which seemed to send the sysop off on a tirade against me.
      But that did not keep me from calling like it would others, in a while
      I grew to like the only bbs. Then I saw an ad on the only bbs for a 
      new BBS called SDF-1, and that's where I fell in love with citadels
      <flashbacks> a year later, I was running my own, and now I'm the writer
      of the Citanews, I FEEL SO RIGHTEOUS!

              
      Section III
      Where's Bill.K?
      He Died

      No He didn't?
      What's your point

      WHERE IS HE!
      He still runs the sinkhole but stopped writing citanews

      THANK YOU
      You're welcome


      Section IV
      The Editorial Spouting off for the month!
       I sure hope this newsletter doesn't reach the folks at Newsweek, they
     might hail it as bigger than the 2nd coming (just because it is is not
     the point) they seem to jump all over anything that has to do with the
     internet or Computer related these days. They just like to ignore that 
     it's been there for 20 years, it's nothing special, all it is is a 
     cheaper, faster way to talk to someone. Anyway, Just my quick 2 cents.

                        "IS ST-KEEP NO MORE!?"

   Well that may indeed be the case.  Andrew Studer has released his
source code to ST-Keep as he can no longer support it's continued
development.  Hopefully some dedicated sysop with the programming
ability may decide to try and continue where Andrew left off.  This
definitely would be a good thing as there are still a number of
Atari users out there.
 
   Here is the "1README.NOW" file from the source code archive...

 -----
 Subject:  ST-Keep GFA Source Code
 From:  Andrew Studer, Author/Designer

 I regret to inform you that I will no longer be supporting ST-Keep Bulletin
 Board System in ANY form.  This includes updates for the future along with
 bug fixes.

 ST-Keep has been a part of my life for over 4 years, but my life has changed
 enough recently that I no longer have time to work on the code.  Because of
 this, I have decided to release the source code so that others may find
 usefulness in it and possibly enhance the system.

 I am not responsible for anything related to ST-Keep, the source code,
 technical support, etc as of this release. 

 If you modify the source code, I will not be able to help you support the
 product.

 If you call my BBS and leave me mail with specific questions that require
 short responses, I will do my best to answer them.  I will not answer any
 questions that will require me to do any research on my old code which I can
 not readily obtain from memory. 
 
 Good luck, thanks for the support and interest, so long...

 -Andy
 ST-Keep BBS       916-729-2968

   Best of luck to Andy with his future endeavours.  And if anyone plans
on taking on further development of ST-Keep, drop us a line!
 
 Column #2
 Citadel History (also uploaded/written by Freejack@fluffadel)

        "WHY WOULD ANYBODY WASTE TIME PRESERVING THIS?"

   My first exposure to room-based systems came in 1987 when I received
a copy of Stonehenge.  I promptly setup a dual-floppy BBS on my brand 
new IBM compatible and had a blast being a sysop.  That lasted for 
about a year before I brought down the system due to an overseas
move.  In late 1993 being a Maximus sysop in the Denver area was quite
enjoyable also.  Then I ran across a system running "Citadel" and I
was immediately flooded with memories a few years past.  Needless to
say Maximus was quickly slain from my computer and a fresh installation
of Gremlin's Citadel replaced it.

   One of the first things to catch my attention concerning the history
of Citadel-based systems was a "family tree" posted on the network I
participated in.  Being a curious person by nature I started gathering
copies of different Citadel releases along with any source code I could
find.  I quickly learned many things concerning the development of various
Citadel "variants".  I also learned that the tree was slightly inaccurate
and missing some information altogether.
 
   So I began to tinker with it and try to add information that I thought
my be interesting.  This quickly became an exercise in futility as there
was much more information than could be accomodated in a simple ASCII 
chart.  So I began an alphabetic listing of the Citadels I knew of that
listed the authors and platforms they ran on.  Then I realized I wanted
to be able to convey even more information that I possessed on some of
the versions.

   Thus was born my little pet project, the "BrickCitHouse".  That being
the room name on my system of my Citadel historical archive.  I began 
by keeping all of the various Citadels in my possession available for
download in that room.  This was followed by including the revised
"family tree" and alpha listing.  I will include the "verbose" listing
soon as I am as about to close to completing it as possible.  That file
itself will be approximately 150k to 200k in size.
 
   My intention is to have a public repository of token copies of any
room-based system as well as any information pertaining to them.  At
this time my system, "Digital Free America", is following me across the
country.  I'll have a permanent home for it in Feb95 at the latest.
Until then I can be reached in the Citanews room and will soon, hopefully, 
gate a "bbs history" room from the network I participate in.  Look for my
requests for info or programs!

Notes:
1. These are mentioned in Bill K.'s RSYS list but I've not seen any other
   information on them from any other sources. These may not have been.   
2. I have this system but have been unable to unarchive it. I need an
   archiver known as LYNX for the C64. This may be Cit-64.
3. These may belong up on the tree. 
5. What is with this name!? I take it Bruce King ran some citadels under
   UNIX and the system was called Babel at one time. I also take it BabeCit
   was once called Babel also? So should this be listed as Babel?  or as
   a Citadel variant (under UNIX)? And it should probably be listed off 
   of Cit 2.10, as I assume that is where is evolved from?
6. I assume this means continued development of Citadel itself out east?
   Well I can't find any! They were apparently some that lasted awhile
   reaching such 'versions' as 2.5x etc.... but any still up?

 Column #4 Citadel+ (uploaded/written by Freejack@fluffadel)

               "CITADEL+ OPENS TO RAVE REVIEWS!"

   What is Citadel+ anyway?  Just another room-based system to come
along as so many before?  Not according to the authors of this feature
laden version previously known as Gremlin's Citadel.  Let's start with 
the opening paragraph from the introduction in the Citadel+ manual.

   "Citadel+ is the most configurable, most powerful, most supported, 
    and all-around best variant of Citadel there is. If you have doubts 
    about this, point us in the direction of a better Citadel and reasons 
    why it is better; we will quickly incorporate any missing features 
    into future versions of the software."

   Wow!  How could anyone make such a claim!?  Well the people behind
Anticlimactic Teleservices have no fear in doing such and simply point
to their product as proof.  So first we'll take a look at their claim
of being the most configurable Citadel.

   I'll start from the SysOp's point of view.  Although you can setup a
Citadel+ system with nothing but the executable and run a BBS with all
it's defaults, one of the most enjoyable aspects of sysoping is creating
a system that you desire.  Well with Citadel+ you will definitely want
the manual as there are over 200 keywords that can be used just in the
main configuration file.  
 
   In addition there are other configuration files in which you can create
a system like no other.  You can setup defaults for new users, which can
definitely help with introducing the room-based concept to people who are
may be used to other linear BBS software popular in your specific region.  
One can custom tailor Citadel+'s response to codes returned from the modem, 
which makes receiving FAXs a breeze.  You can even setup mailing lists that 
support automatic subscription.  

   There are internal protocols that can be used but of course support for 
powerful external ones is extensive.  Doors can be configured in a number 
of ways.  One can setup external editors or utilize various message 
"filters" if they wish to.  And applictions can be tied in almost anywhere, 
automatically or user triggered.  There is even a customization kit to 
allow the changing of just about every string sent out by the system.
 
   Citadel+ supports a variety of networking "protocols".  Of course all
the DragCit types are available but Net6_9 being, by far, the most robust 
is widely used.  It's use of bi-directional transfers cuts the costs of 
networking significantly.  Also with this release there is support for 
networking with Citadel-86 style systems that utilize the MSGADD and 
MSGOUT utilities.  In fact the author of this article plans on being the 
first stable Citadel+ on that network, if he isn't already. And there is 
much much more that I really don't have the time to go on about.

   Now as far as the user's ability to configure their own usage of the
system.  The user's configuration screen is truely amazing.  User's can
setup an amzing amount of items to their own desires.  Everything from
screen attributes to automatic text replacement can be accomplished.  
This version introduces a feature where users may "finger" anyone on the 
network.  There are really too many features to try and touch on and 
doing so is beyond the scope of this article.  

   We now arrive at the "most powerful" claim.  This is a subjective
statement but nonetheless if the above doesn't offer credence the 
following may.  Citadel+ contains a robust script language.  There is 
also the ability to run scripts just about anywhere at anytime.  Anything 
from automated message postings to custom designed displays can be 
accomplished from the more than 500 keywords/functions available.  I 
think one could see where this feature alone can backup the claim of 
being the most powerful Citadel ever.

   The "most supported"?  This statement is truely subjective yet
whole-heartedly backed by the sysops and users of the software.  The
Anticlimactic Teleservices is the moniker the developers choose to use
as the "author" of Citadel+.  This team consists of five very talented
programmers, and they are: Brent Bottles, Richard Finegold, Matthew
Pfleger, Elisabeth Perrin and Don Kimberlin.  This crew goes beyond what 
is normally expected in "product support".  Yet, as the Citadels before 
it, Citadel+ is true freeware.  It can be used in personal or commercial 
environments.
 
   Well now, isn't that a glowing review?  I must admit to being a 
little biased as I myself run a Citadel+ system.  But I choose to for the 
very reason a few people dislike it, the overwhelming amount of features 
available to both the user and sysop.  This does of course require some 
resource to accomplish but the "regular" version can be run on an XT type 
system with 512k of RAM.  While that version is limited to approximately 
32k of messages but the "auxmem" version, that utilizes memory above 640k, 
has no practical limit.

   To try and touch on all the available features is honestly much beyond 
the scope of this article.  To drive that point home the manual itself, 
which is not yet complete, is over 700k of text!  So, be the features 
"useless and twitty" or definitely "citadelian" is somewhat irrelevant as 
the sysop can tailor the system to a level not available with other software.

   To see Citadel+ in action call the support board, The Anticlimactic
Teleservice at (206) 562-9792.  Any questions will be promptly answered and, 
most likely by Brent Bottles or Richard Finegold.  The latest release is 
available there for download at 9600b or for 14.4kb speed call The Raft 
at (206) 861-9936.

 Column #7: Featured Board for the Month, The Fluffadel BBS
 Written by Psychotic Killer@Fluffadel

 Hello all, it's your friendly editor again, The Fluffadel BBS has been online
 24 hours a day since October 11, 1992 (minus a few days between hacks), at
 801-278-0565, It wasn't always the Fluffadel. When I started the fluffadel
 up I was running on an 8088 (yeah so?) with a 1200 baud modem (ick), with 
 a 21 meg hard drive (icky) and I was running WWIV (HOW DID YOU SURVIVE!?!?).
 We were up for a month and a half on that setup, until we got hacked, let me
 tell you, if you've ever run a WWIV you'll be very paranoid. So we started 
 back up on PcBoard (yuck) which I blew some more money on, I didn't like it
 so I switched back to WWIV, and I got hacked again! Well, that's when a new
 citadel was born! I got the software from Sub-Odeon(fluffadel!sdf-2!sub-odeon)
 who has now moved to Washington State and got some help from Crazy Fox, and
 the fluffadel came into town. Anyway, now we're up 24 hours a day on a 14.4
 modem and a monster 486, it has it's problems but at least it hasn't been
 hacked for a year and a half! What can you find on the fluffadel? Loads of
 net rooms? Naaah, we do carry Citanews though, which is our only net room.
 Loads of doors? naah, we have a few, Intelligent conversation? naah, The 
 Fluffadel is as the name states, Pure fluff, 100% fluff, give us a call, and
 maybe even upload an article into the citanews room (hint hint)

 Column #8: Featured Software: Fortress-PC
 Written by Psychotic Killer@fluffadel

 Perhaps I'm not the best source to write an article on fortress, but as far
 as I know The Fluffadel is the biggest Fortress in the country now that 
 undermind died (that's not saying much, fortress-pc is a dying breed too).
 Fortress is more advanced than some of the other citadels, I have yet to 
 find another citadel that supports Ansi. Unfortunately it seems Fortress is
 being Discontinued by CMC, I keep trying to get the source code from him but
 I think my e-mail messages keep getting lost between here and his internet
 host, so if any of you are able to talk to CMC let me know. But anyway, 
 Fortress is actually a continuation of STadel-PC under a different name, it
 was ported to ST by Draiden Bansted (who now runs Fortress-PC, so much for
 support eh?) Fortress-PC (I don't know about ST) of course has all the 
 regular features of Citadel (you know, Twit finger, citanetting), it has a
 screwed up formatter though, but a couple fluffadel users (maalox moment@
 fluffadel, king midas@fluffadel) are in the process of writing some new
 citadel variants, I'm not sure about Midas's but I know Maalox's will fix
 the formatter, more on his software in future issues :) Fortress can be
 downloaded from the BBS softwares room on the Fluffadel at 801-278-0565

 
Note about Citanews:
  Citanews can be downloaded from the Citanews room on the Fluffadel BBS
  at 801-278-0565 or you can subscribe to it at Mikejon@xmission.com, just
  say (uh huh huh, I wanna, heh heh, subscribe to the..citanews.. whoa, 
  blackouts rule!)
  To contribute upload your columns to the citanews room on the fluffadel
