   Well, here it is, maybe not the official version, but at least a
version. Apparently, Dave Quick is supposed to be doing it, but hasn't, and
supposedly Steve Hall is supposed to be taking over, but not till Dave does
the last one. So, well, after seeing it hasn't been done for several
months, and on my LD travels (via US Sprint), and being asked many a time,
when's the next Citanews going to be out, I decided earlier tonight was the
last I wanted to be asked. Ah, boring you, huh, sorry. Well anything I
could think of, is here, provided I could think of it. Any ideas for a
future release (maybe NEWS1088.TXT) will be appreciated. I will do it, as
long as no-one else does.

   Considering I am not with much for ideas, this may indeed be small,
and may even seem a little tied to things I've been working on (happens in
a spur of the moment decision to do it in the first place). Probably in a
totally wrong format too. Oh well here go's.

              What happened to Citanews, and why? ;-)
              ---------------------------------------
   Well, first of all, as we all know, David Quick took over the 'Job'
from Steve Yelvington (right?). He released NEWS0588.TXT (right again?).
Anyway since then he has said he'd have it out for the next edition a few
days late, but didn't. Then a similar comment came the next month. But
nothing. One rumor, was that he has a new Girlfriend, and doesn't have the
time. Fine, though too bad he didn't say something, so someone else could
take it over.
   Next, Steve Hall told me he was going to take it over, and to tell him
about the Amiga room, and how it came to be where it was at that point.
Then a few days later, he said Dave Quick was going to do one last one,
then he was taking over. Oh well, that was about a month ago, and still
nothing. 
   So here I am, getting comments, like where's the latest Citanews?
Could you upload it to us? So I'd explain it.

               The newest National net room: Amiga!
               ------------------------------------
   About 2-4 months ago, between me, and Mike Gritten (SysOp of
BrainStorm Citadel, in Canada, now down temporarily), while in chat,
discussed the possibility of getting a national net room going, supporting
our machines. James Bearce and me were already netting such a room (though
only 2 systems). I mentioned it to James Bearce too, and he liked it too.
So we all mentioned it to Vince Quaresima in mail on Jersey Devil (Since we
were all netting with him anyway, at the time). He said sure, so it had
it's start. Though at this point ours was still a baby.
   There was already a going Amiga room, in the Twin Cities area, and we
thought maybe we could get it connected to that somehow, and then thought,
Jersey Devil was netting with Utica College, and Utica College with Test
System. So I mentioned it to Thom Brown, and he at that point, would at
least get it from Jersey Devil.
   At about this time, an Amiga room formed on the STadel net as well. So
we set forth to figuring out how to get that link, too. At this point, at
least one other South Jersey node had gotten onto our smaller Amiga net. 
   At that point, I typed a large message and put it in all 3 nets,
trying to find nodes interested in getting this going. Though at that time,
Thom Brown agreed to net it with Test System, so the Cities, and ours were
connected. 
   The connection to the ST net's Amiga room, followed shortly. When Gary
Green (SysOp of KAOS) said he'd get it from Utica College. And at the same
time, from THE_LAND. So that is how it has come to be. 
   For the Amiga Users out there, there is now definatly a place for
those unanswered Questions, as well as much info on new Software/Hardware 
and questions, you may be able to answer. Anything Amiga.


                         Atari Corp online now!
                         ----------------------
   Atari Corporation is now running a STadel, and netting on the ST Net.
They are netting Atari ST, C, Modula-2, STadel and several other rooms.
Talk about support. From what I hear, you won't get Tramiel on it, but Tech
support is supposed to be watching. kbad (I think that's the name), is the
one I've seen with messages from the system at Atari. Anyway, they are
netting with THE_LAND. 


                        Expansions on Citadel-86
                        ------------------------
   Citadel get's bigger daily. Now Vince Quaresima is even adding things
from his  Citadel-128 BBS program, to Citadel-86. He has now also added
Doors, and a new, and neat method of mail routing, that leaves very little
for the user to do. Just like entering a net message. I have yet to try it,
but from speaking to Vince in chat, is definatly sounds like a good method.
Among other goodies he added, is the '<', '>', '+', and '-' room/floor
movement commands, he originally put in his Citadel-128.
   What's up next, Vince? Keep up the good work.
   By the way, those interested in getting a better look at Citadel-
86:K2NE, can find it in Citadel] on Jersey Devil at (609) 893-2152.


           Hue is finally taking, a long needed brake. I think.
           ----------------------------------------------------
   According to a message I read a few weeks ago, Hue, Jr may be taking
somewhat a break from his development of Citadel-86. From the tone of a few
messages prior to it, I'd suspect that it might be needed. Hue, get your
break, it'll leave you feeling much better later, and probably up to more
major break throughs in the future, with Citadel-86. 


               Beware, there is a BAD SysOp on the prowel.
               -------------------------------------------
   There is a text file, on Test System, with GIF Format photograph of a
SysOp that is in the business of ripping people off. I guess he is also
wanted by the FBI. Call Test System, and grab it. I think it's in Uploads,
or something like that. 
   Apparently this guy was in Minneapolis, or was it St. Paul? Anyway, he
has skipped town there. Better get a look, he may be headed your way next.


         Some rooms, of interest to some, available at the land.
         -------------------------------------------------------
   There are several rooms, available for netting from THE_LAND, that may
be of some interest to many. The main one is NASA NEWS. UR-LORD (SysOp of
THE_LAND) spends good time, keeping the latest news on NASA in there.
Updates every few days (in the event it isn't every day, as it get's some
times). 
   The other 2 rooms, are ST Report, and Amiga Report. They are both on
the systems they're named after. I guess they come from either Delphi, or
GEnie. Weekly updates. 
   In the room called tele-talk, there is a monthly newsletter available,
on telecommunications. Called tele-talk. Really interesting. 
   THE_LAND can be reached at (513) 254-6811.


Saying of the month. Well, something after all the boredom that preceded
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Gary Green has just changed his notice, to a interesting one.

   Gravity, it's not just a word;  It's the Law!
      (Something like that. Someone quote it, please!)



   Well, as I said, may help to get you less bored with me!


             STadel-Ami, now words, soon to be reality!
             ------------------------------------------
   I am currently porting STadel 3.3a to the Amiga. Those that are
interested keep watching. Should be beta-ing in a week. Surely less than a
month. Anything that STadel 3.3a has, STadel-Ami will have. Orc has been
very helpful, in anyway he could, in this getting done. Even been there for
a few good suggestions. 
   Another person that has been good for some suggestions, as far as door
coding, was Cap'N Dave at The Guild (AmiDel development).


                 Pell is down. Mother Nature done it!
                 ------------------------------------
   Due to lightning hitting Orc's IBM PC Clone, Pell is down. He is going
to be moving again, and then setting back up, at where-ever he moves to.
   In the mean-time, we'll be looking for him.


            Bix members. Check out the js.online group there.
            -------------------------------------------------
   js.online is a group (that the word for it?) on Bix, run by UR-LORD,
and Orc supporting STadel, I think. Anyway, check it out. 
   For more info on Bix, you can contact UR-LORD at THE_LAND ((513) 254-
6811).


                   Award->Busiest Cit I've ever called
                   -----------------------------------
   Another boredom Breaker. I must say, that Images Minnesota, is the
busiest board I've ever called. Sheez, I haven't been able to get through,
now for a month. Sy Borg, keep up the work, they love you, or something.
Running Citadel-68K.


                         The End!.....For now.
                         ---------------------
   Well, like I said, small. I have no experience in writing news-
letters, of any kind. And one covering Citadels, is well, a very
large thing to do.
   I may do one next month, if I don't see any other in the making.
   So catcha at the same time, same station, don't touch that room! Well,
at least that slightly fit. Used to have an instructor that would always
say that (not referring to rooms).
