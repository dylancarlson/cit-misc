     The CITADEL User's Prayer

      Our Citadel, who art in ASCII, hallowed be thy source code. Thy carrier 
come, thy will be done, by keyboard as in ASCII. Give us this day our daily 
login. Forgive us our hacking as we forgive those who hack against us. Lead us 
not into Appleslime and deliver us from ruggies. For thine is the Users and 
their modems, forever and ever. 
  

     CITADEL Psalm 23
   
  Hue is my guru, I shall not want. 
  He maketh me sit down before green terminals. 
  He leadeth me beside the still modems. 
  He restoreth my files; he leadeth me in the paths of source code 
     for his aides' sake. 
  Yeah, though I walk through the valley of the Second City, 
     I shall fear no evil, for thou art with me; 
     thy 1's and thy 0's they comfort me. 
  Thou preparest a .Help FILE for me in the presence of mine enemies; 
     thou alignest my head; my message base runneth over. 
  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, 
     and I shall dwell in the citadel of Hue forever.
