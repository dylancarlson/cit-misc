/*
 * CITANEWS RETURNS
 * Editor caves in and churns out another copy
 */
 
   The last issue of CitaNews was sometime last autumn. Did we say 
monthly? (slap--> face).... Your humble editor has tried to find another
sucker to assemble this monster, and has received a couple of nibbles,
but nobody took the hook and ran with the ball. (Gag). So here's another issue.
The next one will come out as soon as your humble editor has enough
material to put it together. Want it monthly? Want your favorite
system/software mentioned? Put together an article and upload it.
 We ESPECIALLY need information from Seattle, from Stonehenge systems,
from Inner Sanctum, from CitGrem (Gremlin's MS-DOS Citadel), etc.

/*
 * PROMOTE YOUR BBS
 * Be sure you're listed in the national BBS list
 */
  
 The national list of room-based BBS systems has been taken over by
Bill Karpowicz @ Sinkhole Utopia US 203-873-8518. The deadline for 
the monthly list is the 20th. SYSOPS ONLY should leave a message
for Bill and it should include the following information:

System name           number         bps   software    sysop             date
Aardvark !            902-454-0199 o 1200  Cit86 V3    Stuart Glen       87Dec
                                   ^
                                   policy: o for open, etc.

  Bill can be contacted at Sinkhole Utopia, Pell (US 612-377-9239) or 
Funny Farm (US 317-842-7564).
  The list is distributed as RSYSxxxx.LST, where xxxx is the date
(0388 for March 1988, for example.)
 
/*
 * WHAT'S UP IN MINNESOTA
 * New versions of STadel, Citadel-86, Citadel Plus
 */
   
  Since the last issue of CitaNews, both STadel and Citadel-86 have had
several upgrades in the 3.xx version series. Both systems now feature
optional floor organization of rooms, more uploading/downloading protocols
and enhancements to the file access system. STadel now has a built-in
archive table-of-contents reader; C86 now inserts a file description in 
the message that is automatically posted in a room whenever a user uploads 
a file. There have been other changes too numerous for us to digest at
the moment. (Networking is discussed in another article in this issue.)

  STadel, which runs on any Atari ST, is available by mail from the author.
His note: "Send me three disks (single-sided disks; If your machine will handle 
double-sided disks, all you need to do is send me two disks) and a SASE (or 
$8.00 and I'll buy the disks and the envelope) and I'll send you all the 
various bits of STadel." Write to:

  Citadel-86, which runs on PC clones and the Zenith Z100, is available
by downloading from Test System or Illusions in the Twin Cities. Here's
a note from Hue, Jr.:
  -------- --------- ---------  -------- --------- ---------
   88Feb25 10:18 pm from Hue, Jr. @ C-86 Test System
   C-86 SYSOPS, I am almost ecstatic to announce that V3.03 is available.  Due 
to the extended time between the release of 3.01 and 3.03, (caused by various 
problems) MM and I have taken the liberty of making an ARC file of CTDL.EXE, 
CONFG.EXE (which is now at 9.7, fixing a number of problems), INCREM.12 & 
INCREM.13, a real, true Operator's Manual, and various other gunk.  
Essentially, this ARC file is good for upgrading any system at V3, V3.01, 
V3.02, or V3.03 -- if you are at V3, the ARC file contains SETUP31.ARC, which 
you should absolutely run before you do almost anything else. 
   So, where can you get this, says you?  Well, of course it is available on 
Test System in Latest Citadel.  However*, if you are going to request this 
via the network, I ask that you request it from the room Update] on 
Illusions, (612) 470-0093 300/1200/2400 (nets from 3:00 to 3:45 Twin Cities 
time), because Test System is very* heavily into traffic these days. 
   In particular, if you are doing backboning, you should get this. 
   The name of the file that is in both Latest Citadel on Test System and 
Updateon Illusions is CTDL303.ARC.  It's about 250K. 
   Good luck, and thank ghod that's over with! 
  -------- --------- ---------  -------- --------- ---------

  Jay Johnson's Amigados Citadel-68K continues to be frozen in version 2.14,
unfortunately. We heard earlier this year that he had returned to the
compiler with the latest version of Hue, Jr.'s C86 source code, but then
we heard otherwise. Jay's system, the Phoenix, has a new number: 612-739-6953.
Amigados Citadel is available for downloading there.

  Corvair's Citadel Plus for the Commodore 128's CP/M mode is being 
enhanced; Corvair is working to install C86-compatible networking.
Corvair reports that the best way to get a copy is by contacting a beta
tester, such as Janus @ Black Service US 612 774 0133. Corvair's
Garage is down for the time being.

  We haven't checked in awhile on the status of Hue, Sr.'s NeoCitadel,
a Cit-alike written in Turbo Pascal. Maybe next issue. If you're interested
in NeoCitadel, contact Hue, Sr. @ Supercomp II, US 612 431 1107.

/*
 * WHAT'S UP IN CALIFORNIA?
 * Sacramento Citadel activity
 */
 
  A group of Sacramento BBS operators has been working on upgrading
the old CP/M Citadel in the direction of Citadel-86. We had a note
here about the project, but it seems to have slipped off the disk.
Sacra-mentors: An article for CitaNews would be appreciated.

/*
 * MN-BASED CITADEL NETWORKS EXPAND AND DIVIDE
 * Incompatibilities arise, but the message traffic still grows
 */

  It wasn't long ago that the first Citadel network message jumped
across the Canadian-American border on a connection between STadel
systems in Minnesota and Nova Scotia.

  Now there's a steady flow of international message traffic,
with STadel and Citadel-86 systems located throughout the United
States communicating with their peers in several Canadian provinces.
There's even a STadel node in Milan (Milano), Italy, called ST-Log
that networks intermittently with Pell in Minneapolis.

  Here are two network maps. The first is from STadel's point of view;
the second is from Citadel-86 Test System. If your city should
be indicated and isn't, contact CitaNews.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  With this growth, the network's rudimentary message-routing
capabilities needed enhancement. Citadel-86 and STadel both have
changed, and the changes have brought about some incompatibilities.

  STadel's current incompatibilities with C86 networking are: 
  * STadel can receive a net call without being in net mode
  * System password works differently 
  * Long-distance roomsharing is completely incompatible 
  * STadel offers private mail routing; C86 doesn't
 
  Room-sharing among local systems is not affected; an STadel can be
a ``peon'' client of a C86 backbone and vice versa, but a C86 system
cannot communicate with an STadel system as a backbone-to-backbone
long-distance relationship.

/*
 * ACCESS LEVELS, TIME LIMITS AND DOWNLOADING
 * How much should a Citadel system support?
 */

  Citadel programmers have shunned the ``accounting features''
included in other BBS programs as a matter of philosophy. Where other
programs seem obsessed with secrecy, security levels and discouraging
various user practices, Citadel has provided an open environment,
encouraging user participation.

  With the strengthening of Citadel's file-transfer capabilities,
however, a number of system operators have asked for some sort of
controls over system use, especially downloading. A number of user
groups have considered STadel as a download system, but have balked
at not being able to place controls on the amount of downloading in a
single session.

  Hue, Jr., and orc have been working on various forms of limits.
Hue's approach in C86 is to limit the amount of time a user can spend
downloading files; orc's is to limit the number of kilobytes of data
that a user can download.

  Another possible change orc has mentioned: "The network may be
modified a bit so that the receiving machine sends back a site ID --
I've found that when I call a system at the same time as a system
calls me (this happens at least once/night), I lose a call.  And it
can't be guaranteed that the site I'm calling is the site that is
calling me...."

  On a somewhat related topic, Royce Howland in Alberta reports a
dangerous side effect of the tremendous increase in network traffic:
a system's temporary net files may overwhelm its disk capacity: 

   His report: "My board recently got swamped by a huge net-transfer
from Chaos II. Chaos apparently hadn't gotten through to Test System
for a night or two, and thus when the connection was finally made,
there was a huge amount of net traffic to be passed along.  Now,
unfortunately, I didn't have enough free space in my net directory to
handle the volume.  So things blew up.  Aide> never said a word about
what had happened.  Since I'm a pretty savvy guy (:-), I figured out
what had gone down.  But others might have trouble (indeed, one node
of our swarm had exactly the same recurring problem, and didn't know
what was going on...so the Sysop dropped off the net)." 

  
 

/* 
 * UNIX CITADEL: ROOMS WITH MULTIPLE USERS? 
 * Taking a port to multi-task 
 */

   No, Unix is not the word for those fat little guys who guard the
harem.

   Unix is a trademark for AT&T's multiuser, multitasking computer
operating system. Versions and clones of Unix run on machines as big
as the Cray-2 supercomputer and as small as a PC. It's especially
popular in scientific/technical environments.

   Unix has a legion of almost fantatical supporters who have been
predicting for years that Unix would sweep the industry. Now they may
be right. IBM's PS/2 and Microsoft's OS/2 have thrown the PC industry
into disarray just as Unix-based systems preparing to bloom: Apple's
Macintosh A/UX, Steve Jobs' NeXT system and a flood of (relatively)
cheap high-powered workstations from Sun Microsystems. Atari Corp. is
offering Idris for the ST and claims it will sell a 68020 or 030-based
Unix box for networks, as well as its mysterious parallel-processing
Abaq, which will run a Unix-like operating system called Helios.

   Unix- and Xenix-based BBS systems are beginning to show up all
over the United States. The quality of the BBS software varies rather
widely. Some sysops, determined to reinvent the wheel, seem to be
trying to make one that's square. We're seeing not only menus and
numbered messages, but also disastrous attempts at implementing
full-screen message editors.

   Fortunately, there are reports of projects to port Citadel to
Unix. It's a natural matchup. After all, the C programming language
-- the basis of Citadel -- was invented so that the Unix operating
system could be written.

   David (orc) Parsons, author of STadel, has been tinkering with
such a port for months. Now he has acquired an AT&T Unix PC and says
he'll convert the latest version of STadel as soon as it's debugged.
(He's also mentioned that he may create Amiga and Macintosh versions
of STadel.)

   We also recently saw this note about another Unix port:
   --------   --------   --------   --------   --------   --------
   88Mar02 3:22 pm from Peter Clark
It's running on my private voice line right now.  I'm gonna set up a board 
soon (a proper 24 hour one) in England, and you will all be able to call it.  
As fer detecting CD there is no machine specific stuf, I initialise the modem 
and set it into an endless loop like this: 
  Start 
  | KeyAtConsole 
  |      | 
  Y      N 
  |      | 
 IsQuit?  - IsMsgFrmModem? 
  |               | 
  Y  N           Y     N 
  Q  ToStart   FndBaud  ToStart 

   88Mar02 3:24 pm from Peter Clark
Incase U didn't understand my msg, I loop round looking for key from console 
or modem message.  It the key at console is quit then I drop to Unix/Xenix.  
If the modem sent a message, then I look to see (in a user defined table) 
what bauds are valid and what was reported.  Else, I just loop endlessly for 
ever and ever and ever and ever waiting for a caller.  Else it's just a 
normal Citadel-86.  
   --------   --------   --------   --------   --------   --------

   Unix is a multiuser system, but Citadel running under Unix would
not necessarily support multiple users at once. Citadel and its
derivatives are designed as single-user programs.

   The Amiga version, Citadel-68K, runs in a multitasking
environment, but only one caller can use the system at a time.
Similarly, Citadel-86 can be run under DoubleDos on a PC Clone.
We have had conflicting reports about running Citadel-86 under
DesqView; we hope for a full report in the next issue of CitaNews.

   STadel can be run in ``background'' under Amulti, a shareware
multitasker, and probably under Beckemeyer Development Systems' Micro
RTX as well. Jeffrey McArthur @ Gateway has volunteered to be a
tester/victim running STadel as a background task under RTX/
Multitasking C Shell and from Gulam with MX2, another freeware
multitasker.

   In these schemes, the system operator can run one or more other
programs concurrently -- perhaps a text editor or a compiler.

   Creating a true multiuser BBS that adheres to the Citadel command
and room structure probably would require a major rewrite. That's the
approach being taken by Morning Star in the Twin Cities:
   --------   --------   --------   --------   --------   --------
   88Feb23 2:11 am from Morning Star @Haven II
   I have recieved various inquiries about my working on a new 
Citadel program. To everyone wondering: Yes I'm working on a Unix Citadel 
(unidel) and I am making progress on it. I'm not sure when it'll be 
up, because I am doing the whole thing from scratch i've looked at the Citadel 
source code (just once) promptly freaked, and decided 
 if I wanted to learn C better, I needed a project.. 
  well.. 
  Another thing, various people have listed Grand Central Station as a bbs 
 well its not (yet) it does answer the phone, but it's a Unix system and
we have people that do* use it remotly. if you want to call it, log on as
guest and leave me validation info. I'll be getting back to you when 
the bbs goes up.. 
 I just thought I'ld let everyone in... 
   --------   --------   --------   --------   --------   --------
   There probably are other, similar, projects under way. CitaNews
would like to hear about them.

nets'' -- Usenet, BITnet, ARPAnet and their relatives. These networks
connect mainframes and minicomputers at literally thousands of
universities, research centers and private businesse s. Usenet alone
has more than 5,000 installations. Each of these networks has
``gateways'' to the others, and collectively they constitute a truly
global computer network.

   What gets networked? Mail is an obvious answer, but, for many
users, the most interesting part of these ``wide-area networks'' are
the public conferences. There are conferences on a wide variety of
subjects, many (but not all) related to computers. To participate in
a conference, you ``subscribe'' by registering with a conference
moderator, who puts you on an electronic mailing list. Thereafter,
messages ``mailed'' to the conference are ``echoed'' to you, the
subscriber. Some conferences are collected and edited into digests;
some conferences are available only as digests (sort of like
electronic magazines.)

   Usenet, the wide-area network of Unix and compatible systems,
consists of automated file transfers among machines running UUCP
(Unix-Unix Copy Program) or a compatible ``mailer.''

   Generally, these wide-area networks are available only to people
with university or other connections to mainframe and large
minicomputer systems. Recently several compatible programs (such as
UUPC) have allowed personal computers to gain access to the nets.

   STadel, the Atari ST version of Citadel, has had Usenet mailing
capability for many months through UUCALL, an external program that
STadel can run at scheduled times. Recently David (orc) Parsons added
a feature that merges Usenet conference messages i nto a Citadel
discussion room.

   The feature was tested for a week in February 1988 as messages
from Usenet's comp.sys.atari.st conference were channeled into a room
of that name at Pell (US 612-426-1374). The UUCALL program cleans the
messages of Usenet's long and complicated header fields, then enters
them into the STadel message base as if they came in from another
networked STadel system.

   It was great, but there are drawbacks. Orc turned off the feature
after the test, since the tremendous volume of messages can overwhelm
the rest of the BBS. Another potential drawback is the responsibility
a sysop must bear for the messages entered ont o the network. If
public BBS systems develop a reputation as sources of problems for
the network, it may become difficult or impossible to obtain a Usenet
connection.

   Many major cities have Unix user groups that can provide aid and
advice on setting up a Usenet node. Another source of information is
the computer science department of any university.

   For those who already have Usenet connections, Parsons' network
address is orc@pell.UUCP or ihnp4!meccts!stag!pell!orc

 * INFECTION, DESTRUCTION AND A MEDIA SCARE 
 * Invasion of the computer viruses 
 */

    ``It could be a science-fiction nightmare come to life,'' warns
the New York Times. Kevin Kelley, an editor of the Whole Earth
Review, likens it to AIDS. What is it? The recent outbreak of
``computer viruses'' embedded in public-domain and shareware
programs. The outbreak has been getting headlines in newspapers that
look like something out of the National Enquirer.

   For years, system operators have been on the lookout for ``Trojan
horse'' programs that pretend to be harmless utilities, then turn
malevolent, performing such acts of vandalism as reformatting the
user's hard disk.

   Computer viruses are potentially even worse: Like biological
viruses, they can replicate themselves and attach themselves to
unsuspecting ``hosts,'' generally burrowing into the operating
system. 

   Two relatively innocuous virus-like programs have touched off a
storm of news coverage recently.

   The first, dubbed the ``Christmas virus,'' was really just an
automated electronic chain letter, a Christmas greeting that
instructed the user to type ``Christmas.'' That action prompted the
program to dip into the user's mailing list and send copies o f
itself to every name it found there. The Christmas card was written
by a West German student; it migrated to North America via BITnet and
eventually found its way into IBM Corp.'s private network, where it
reportedly flooded the system with trash mail and brought the
network to a virtual halt.

   The Christmas card wasn't quite a virus because it didn't
``infect'' other programs. The Macintosh ``Church of the SubGenius''
virus, however, is real, if benign. It infects the system files of
any Macintosh that is used to run the program it uses as i ts
``disease vector.''

   The SubGenius bug's programmers publish a magazine called MacMag
in Montreal, Canada. On March 2, the virus is scheduled to become
active and display this message: ``Richard Brandow, publisher of
MacMag, and its entire staff would like to take this opp ortunity to
convey their universal message of peace to all Macintosh users around
the world.'' Programmer Peter Lount called the virus an artistic act
intended to celebrate the anniversary of the introduction of the Mac
II.

   The programmers describe themselves as followers of the ``Church
of the SubGenius;'' hence the name. Before you jump to conclusions
about cults, you should know that there isn't any such thing; it's
just a label that pops up occasionally, attached to v arious pranks.
The ``church'' supposedly deifies a cartoon character named Bob who
is something like Ward Cleaver with a lobotomy, and promotes a
philosophy of life that is straight out of Zippy the Pinhead.

   How did the Mac virus get distributed? The culprit was NEWAPP.STK,
a Hypercard application that was available briefly on CompuServe. The
virus supposedly detaches itself from the application, burrows into
the system, and waits for March 2.

   There have been vague reports of far more malevolent viruses
attached to IBM-PC and Amiga software, and a lot of talk that viruses
will bring an end to public-domain software distribution and threaten
the existence of wide-area computer networks. Some corporations, such
as Hewlett-Packard, are said to have banned PD and shareware.

   Is this real? Or just a scare? If you've encountered any viruses,
CitaNews would like to know.
