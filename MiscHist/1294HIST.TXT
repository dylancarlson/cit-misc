 if i remember correctly, bruce king's software on polarserve was called 
babel. never called it much, but it wasn't a bad room system at the time. he 
was running a charles river data systems superbox V and it was pretty fast 
compared to dinse's system.

 MiniBin was written in TRSBasic, which itself was hight EXTENDED by Glenn 
Gorman and Robert Dinse (of Eskimo fame).  All the machine language routines 
were actually extensions to the built-in basic, so MB itself was written 
fully in BASIC.  Worked damn good, for what it was.  The printout listing of 
the MINIBIN source (basic part) was less than 200 lines in its' entirety! 

     94Dec05 04:36:43 AM From Blain Nelson @ Blain's World (not!) BBS, Ferndale
Freejack -- Andy is available on the Internet.  I've traded e-mail with him 
once or twice.  I think he's on the Cit mail-list.  If you can't get ahold of 
him through there, I'll look for his address in my sent-mail folder. 

    94Dec04 18:40:35 PM From Twoflower @ The Fourth Tower, Olympia
  
 I'll answer as many question as I can remember, Freejack. 
  
 Andy was cerebus. and he did write Elegia, which he eventually turned into a 
Citadel-styled shell for linux.  I do not know if he is still working on it (I 
really doubt it,) since he is currently in the process of putting up a mud (run
a machine that is owned by Z'ton, author of TwitCit, in fact.) 
  
 TwitCit was a decendant from 3.10, and Elegia 3.11 (I think.)  Z'ton (real 
name Lou) was good friends with the Dragon until they had a falling out... They
used to work together on DragCit. 
  
 Joe Broxson ran TGLC (The Greenlake Connection) then changed his BBS to C' 
Hacker's Forum and changed software from early GremCit to DragCit.  Eventually 
he became involved in the DragCit development.  I'm sure he ran his own version
of it on CHF. 
===whack it===              
<Continuous +>
  
 Red Dorakeen was teaching himself C while playing with DragCit source code.  
He eventually felt that he had made enough changes to put his stamp on it, and 
ran several different BBSes before moving in with Saphyre and taking his system
down.  He now lives in Quilcene, WA (aknowleged as the Middle of Nowhere by a 
leading Citadel developer.) 
  
 Turtle! was Shane Johnson. 
  
 Mistress Mouse and her husband (I cannot recall his name) took Citadel source 
code and hacked many of the features to come up with Citadel ][.  Most users 
used to "standard" Citadel were put off by the changes, and the fact that MM 
and her husband planned to market the software through their hardware retail 
business.  The software proved buggy and unpopular, and I believe they gave it 
to Turtle! who created M.O.D.E. from it. 
  
 Zen master and Jeremiah Johnson work on Co-Op Cit.  Zen master also does 
FrogCit, which may or may not be Co-Op Cit with another name.  You would have 
to speak to them about getting source (which I'd really doubt, personally.) 
  
 Hope that's enough (and all correct...  after years of the soap opera that is 
Citadel things get a bit fuzzy.) 

    94Dec06 00:56:04 AM From Little Nemo @ Slumberland
  
 I don't know what z'ton's up to now, but Slumberland used to run TwitCit. For 
quite a while, even. And Shari's board ran it until quite recently, though the 
board wasn't up the whole time. 

    94Dec06 03:55:58 AM From Livia @ Amber, Bellevue
 and roscoecit was actually called "neon pagoda" 

    94Dec06 14:08:55 PM From JayDee @ Loka, @ TukwilaHell
  
  wasn't that George's (Kid C's) version of Cit that Shades of Blue ran on? 

    94Dec05 23:14:25 PM From Pun master @ Age of Aquarius
 Freejack: to address your first message... 1. I think so.. Joe ran C' Hackers 
Forum, using his own code, though he shared code with Dragon and Ray.  2. not 
really; the code which was going to make 'Kremlin' unique was an alteration of 
DRAGON.C (hard-coded border lines) to feature Willun instead of Dragon.  Fred 
always listed it even though I think it was only compiled once. 

    94Dec06 21:55:05 PM From Counselor @ Blind Man's Bluff, Kirkland
  
 i believe Mistress Mouse's husband's name was Vern Bear.   
  
 And, yes, JayDee.

Notes:
1. These are mentioned in Bill K.'s RSYS list but I've not seen any other
   information on them from any other sources. These may not have been.   
2. I have this system but have been unable to unarchive it. I need an
   archiver known as LYNX for the C64. This may be Cit-64.
3. These may belong up on the tree. 
5. What is with this name!? I take it Bruce King ran some citadels under
   UNIX and the system was called Babel at one time. Bob P. changed the
   name of his CP/M cit due to this. So is it Babel or Citadel(under UNIX)?
   And it should probably be listed off of Cit 2.10....
6. I assume this means continued development of Citadel itself out east.
   Well I can't find any! They were apparently some that lasted awhile
   reaching such 'versions' as 2.5x etc....

 There is also a Macadel (not MacCitadel), a port of Cit86. It is quite evil 
and non Mac-like. :)

 heck, I had the Quartz unix cit a while ago. 

    94Dec08 13:44:41 PM From Ketamine @ Saltlick Of Desire
  
 Atlas was derived from GremCit source, not DragCit I believe. 
  
 All the good features were eventually moved into further versions of GremCit 
as well.

you mean no one has written a cit in fortran?  :)

IF I make a cit, I'm going to call it SitUbuCit.

 Z'ton's working with Andy at Skylight.  Last I heard he also was running Red 
Dwarf as a unix system at the same old phone #.  Could have changed, though.  I
think he moved out. 

    94Dec07 19:26:08 PM From Freejack @ Digital Free America, CyberHell
i've contacted Andy through Bable (sort of) and i was told that the tree needed
a line from elegia to gremcit also. he says there is code from elegia in 
gremcit... true? 

    94Dec07 19:26:37 PM From Freejack @ Digital Free America, CyberHell
btw, i've added BabeCit code and executables to the archive...

 last I heard there was an andy.c at one point or another ...

  Freejack: 
  
 DragCit Rev B and Joe Broxson did exist. Joe Broxson still does exist. (At 
least, he did sometime within the last year. Well, I didn't actually talk to 
him, but I talked to someone who said that she had talked to, and seen, him 
several times.) The Greenlake Connection (later named C' Hacker's Forum) ran 
it. (206)782-6669, I think. 
  
 I have never heard of Kremlin. 
  
 RoscoeCit was a very slightly modified DragCit 3.12, which then got renamed to
Neon Pagoda and was very slightly modified a bit more.  I cannot think of what 
he did to change it right now, other than changing the name. 
  
 Turtle!'s real name is Shane Johnson. He is responsible for M.O.D.E. (Modem 
Oriented Download Environment), which was a very slightly modified Citadel 1.30
from The Gremlin. 
  
 Dargos is, of course, the author of youAreHere()!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
  
 Andy is Andy Quinn, who has used several nyms in his life. cerebus. would 
probably be his most famous. I doubt that Elegia is still being developed. I 
lost his phone number, but still remember how to drive to his house, unless he 
has moved in the last couple of years. 
  
 John at SOD is Angela Davis. 
  
 Mistress Mouse is responsible for ruining M.O.D.E. and creating Citadel II, in
which they changed all of the command keys around, just because they could. 
  
 Z'Ton is Louis Ericson, or Mad Lou. He and Peter (The Dragon) were close, and 
co-worked on DragCit for some time. 
  
 I was not aware that there was a previous Citadel Plus. 
  
  
  Richard: 
  
 The profiler doesn't tell you must about memory. Actually, it tells you 
nothing. 
  
 With multiple comparisons, it would be faster and smaller to assign a 
temporary variable and do comparisons on it, rather than repeatedly calling 
GetContextSensitiveText, of course. 
  
  
  Twoflower: 
  
 Shane gave M.O.D.E. to Mistress Mouse, not the other way around. 
  
 Other than that, you have as much accuracy as I have. 
  
  
  Counselor: 
  
 Yes, I remember his name as Vern Bear, as well. 
  
  
  Freejack: 
  
 Drop the Ltd on Anticlimactic Teleservices. 
  
 drop the * on GremCit 3.20/xxx. 
  
 Citadel 1.27 was never called GremCit officially. 
  
 I have 1.30 executables and source around here somewhere. I'll try to remember
to look for them some time. 
  
  
  Ketamine: 
  
 As I remember it, John did to Atlases, one based on ACit, and one based on 
GremCit. 
  
  
  dred: 
  
 Malcolm Petcher made a Citadel 1.27 trap-file analyzer some time in the late 
80s which he wrote in Fortran. That's about as close as Fortran has come to 
Citadel, I believe. 
  
  
  Freejack: 
  
 Andy() in andy.cpp is a slightly modified routine directly from Elegia.  If 
one routine counts, then go ahead and put a line in if you want. That's the 
only elegia code that I can think of that is in Citadel+. (It was put in when 
it was called GremCit, though, so if you put in the line, put it in there.)

 I seem to recall being at Z'ton's house one day and seeing an Apple ][ and 
being told that Z'ton (Mad Lou at the time) was writing a room system for it.
 
 If this existed, what was its name?  Any relation to Lumadel? 
  
  
 Oh, and if one routine counts, maybe you should draw a line from Stonehenge as
well, for those wonderful BitBag routines.

The original macintosh was based on the 68000 CPU. The 68000 CPU has only 24 
address lines. However, pointers were 32 bits. 
  
 Apple looked at this, and saw that they had 8 bits to play with in every 
pointer for storing some stuff. (I don't have reference books here, or I'd be 
able to tell you exactly what gets stored in them. It has to do with whether 
the memory block is locked in place, and other memory-management issues like 
that.) 
  
 However, they also knew that at some time in the future, they may want to use 
all 32 bits for addresses. (They used the unused 8 bits in the 32 bit addresses
instead of just allocating another byte for it because the original Macintosh 
had 128K of RAM. That's not much.) 
  
 So, they created functions in the OS for accessing the extra 8 bits of 
information stored in the 32-bit addresses. 
  
  However, doing bit-manipulation directly is quite a bit faster than calling 
an OS function to do it for you. (Obviously.) 
  
 So, some software writers played with the bits directly, in the interest of 
creating faster (and smaller) programs. 
  
 Guess what happened to those programs when Apple started using all 32 bits for
memory addresses? 
  
  Bad things. 
  
  From what I remember, you have to reboot your computer and turn off 32 bit 
access to run such programs. This limits you to 8M of RAM. (8M of RAM? Bit 24 
address lines gives you 16M! That's because in the 24-bit memory model, ROM 
started at the 8M barrier, and the OS needs RAM to be contiguous. I don't 
remember where ROM starts in the 32-bit memory model, but it is somewhere up in
the gigabytes.)

an old Citanews refers to a COBOL-based citadel. i think they may have been 
talking about that CitSim for the WICAT multi-user mini, but i've been unable 
to unearth more info at this time. but i'm getting pretty adept at digging this
stuff up so hopefully it won't be long till i know for sure.

I was considering writing a console only (but nettable) Cit in WordPerfect's 
macro language. 

    94Dec13 14:03:41 PM From Flying Wombat @ Blind Man's Bluff, Kirkland
 I was thinking of writing a Citadel in Ratfor for the HP 1000, but haven't 
done anything about it.  according to the boasters at Microsoft, one could 
write just about anything in Foxpro.. including Windows itself.  heh. 

    94Dec13 19:08:22 PM From Lab Rat @ The Laboratory, Multithreading Hell
 I was thinking about writing a citadel in the sand down by the beach.  there'd
be one big long section of sand in which people could write their messages with
their names and what rooms they went in, and other people could come along and 
read the messages the other people left. 
 But I never got around to it.  It probably would have just washed away anyhow.
  
 But yes, I think my HP48GX with it's 128k ram and actual serial port plug 
could probably do better service as a cit than the TI-8x.  Especially since my 
HP48GX has it's own assembly language (assuming I could get Brent to code for 
it of course...)

 from what i can tell by looking at the Atlas source it comes from DragCit... 
 and if the "tree" were to include branches back and forth between all the 
 DragCit descendants, it would look quite silly, considering the amount of 
 sharing between all the developers. 

    94Dec14 04:28:51 AM From Livia @ Amber, Bellevue
 atlas comes from the version of gremcit which came from dragcit (which came 
from an earlier version of gremcit) 
  
 woo hoo 

    94Dec12 06:50:07 AM From Freejack @ Digital Free America, CyberHell
 thanks for all those answers Brent! (and to think i've been talking to 
 Z'Ton on Bob P's system and not even knowing it...) 
  
 i plan on redoing the tree to reflect parallel developments but not by 
 putting in lines to and fro everywhere. (i think that would look quite 
 silly...) 
  
 i'm not going to try and maintain a BBS list any longer. i will forward 
 any info to Bill K. who maintains the large one. i may even gate the 
 bbslist room from the cit86 net after i start netting it. 
  
 i'm going to submit an article and try to help a sysop on that net to 
 revive Citanews with info on Cit+. (which i've proudly gabbed about on 
 that network anyway...) 
  
 and now i'm going to finish reading new messages so i can then go out 
 in the cold and replace the muffler on my car.

 um, if Dargos is the author of youAreHere()!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 does that make him truely evil? 

    94Dec13 17:38:10 PM From Captain James T Kirk @ Starfleet Academy, Olympia
Which calculator?  i 've thought of writing one for the HP48...  it has a 
serial port...  (it'll even do 9600 baud...and internal xmodem..) 

    94Dec14 12:01:23 PM From Bang The Nun Slowly @ Saltlick Of Desire
 Atlas isn't even a distinct product.  It's just GremCit.  Angela Davis is a 
plagerist.  Take the damn thing off the tree! 

    94Dec13 23:26:29 PM From Little Nemo @ Slumberland
  
 No, switch to a Mac for everything else, just save your old PC for the 
Citadel.  :) Anyway, Brent's explanation is good. In MacCitadel's  case, it 
just crashes if you try to run it with 32-bit addressing turned on. 

    94Dec14 11:34:40 AM From Alpha Wolf @ Palace of the Miniken, Kirkland
youarehere()? 
 that little thing. 
  
  save the size of the source and the executeable 
  and take it out...  
  
 hmm... who originally put in networking in citadels? 

    94Dec14 17:39:51 PM From dred @ Holiday Inn, Lynden
LR is/was writing a Cit for his calculator as well?  I have a Sharp, it has 
internal BASIC, maybe it'd work. 

    94Dec14 18:59:34 PM From Captain James T Kirk @ Starfleet Academy, Olympia
Someone has figgured out how to program the TI85 in asm...  So there should be 
many interesting programs comming out for it in the near future...  (but i'll 
bet it'll be a while befor it can do 4-shade grey-scales like the HP48 can....)


    94Dec14 19:01:47 PM From Captain James T Kirk @ Starfleet Academy, Olympia
I've always wondered...why isn't ROM stuck at the start of the address space?  
then you don't have to work around it...   

    94Dec16 05:05:55 AM From Richard Goldfinder
 Captain James T Kirk: on some CPUs (e.g. Motorola 6502), there are 
instructions for accessing the lowest area of memory with fewer bytes (since 
high address bits are assumed to be zero). 
 On an Intel 8086, the lowest 1024 bytes is used for an interrupt jump table, 
and a reset tells the CPU to go to FFFF:0000. 

    94Dec16 15:52:45 PM From scorpio @ Dystopia ][, Bellingham
 alpha wolf.. 
 i think it was errhead... 
 who else would call it NET69? 
 :) 

    94Dec17 06:05:03 AM From Livia @ Amber, Bellevue
 err head designed net69 (matt implemented it) 
  
 but there was networking in citadels long before that 

    94Dec17 14:41:20 PM From Brent Bottles @ The Anticlimactic Teleservice
Captain James T Kirk: Where would you put the interrupt vector table on the 
80x86, if you started ROM at 0000:0000? 
  
 Suppose you redesigned the chip to put the IVT at the last 1K of the 1M space 
of the 8086. 
  
 What happens when you introduce the 80286 with its 16M address space? Or the 
80386 with its 4G address space? You get non-contiguous memory usage. 
  
 Or, suppose that you don't worry about future chips, and you put the 1K IVT at
the end of the 1M address space, and put ROM in the first 64K of the 1M address
space. 
  
 What happens when you add some more routines to your ROM, and it takes 65K to 
store it? You get... noncontiguous memory!

Little Nemo: What makes 'Macadel' so evil? what is the software itself like? is
it fairly new? does it operate alright?... please tell me. 

    94Dec17 15:19:33 PM From Akira @ beggars banquet, damn
 is Cit+ the Only Citadel being developed? 
  
 Or being worked on? 

    94Dec18 15:58:41 PM From Joe
        j/h^m from a dos standpoint. Ray is ditching turbocit and is in fact 
giving away his source code to registered users. I must admit that I am not 
interested in it, but whom ever is can ask him for it. If I ever get my hands 
on a unix cit, I'll compile it and see what gives. 

    94Dec18 14:39:20 PM From Flying Wombat @ Critter Haven
 Akira: not at all.

 ((clap-clap)) GOOD ANSWER! GOOD ANSWER! 

    94Dec19 00:26:38 AM From Little Nemo @ Slumberland
  
 Akira: Macadel is a port of Cit-86. The interface sucks. It is completely 
unsuited for the mac, and it's very difficult to set up and get it to work. I 
thought it sucked mightily, to be frank... 

    94Dec16 23:45:38 PM From golden spud @ Golden Spud's Greasehouse, Custer
I want to progarm my TI85 in ASM! 

    94Dec16 18:30:20 PM From Captain James T Kirk @ Starfleet Academy, Olympia
Lab Rat>>  a GX?  lucky you...  i could only afford a G...  i'm thinking about 
upgrading it to 256k...  (i have a file with instructions on how to add two 
128k chips to it...)...   

    94Dec18 14:00:17 PM From FRuG @ Dystopia ][, Bellingham
SpudCit is also being developed. 

    94Dec18 16:17:21 PM From golden spud @ Golden Spud's Greasehouse, Custer
Lab Rat offered to show me his manhood (read calculator) 
  
 But I declined, I was in a hurry to leave the get-together. 
  
  
 Akira> Cit+ is definately not the only Cit being developed. As most people 
already know, I am working on Golden Spud's Citadel (SpudCit). Since I only 
started writing it a couple months ago, it is by far not as capable of Cit+ and
will probably never try to clone everything in it. It will have a separate 
identity. 
  
 There was some confusion as to whether or not I was serious about the whole 
thing at the beginning. 
  
 Now people (more and more of them) have actually seen it or even used it 
(experienced what little it does at this point) so now people are waiting for 
me to release it :) 

    94Dec19 17:32:48 PM From Phil @ modigliani, Kirkland
 PhilCit (Citadel/UX + Ansi) is under development. mandrake belladonna 
connection is moving to linux, so fortress is out and Cit/UX in. but i couldn't
stand the lack of color, so i'm adding it. 

    94Dec20 16:13:47 PM From Cloister the Stupid @ Amber, Bellevue
    Hot darn, Phil-i-kins. 
    Now, dear, tell me what you are doing up there... 

    94Dec19 16:00:40 PM From Captain James T Kirk @ Starfleet Academy, Olympia
golden spud>> the ti85 can be programmed in asm...  read the 
bit.listserv.calc-ti newsgroup...(or i supose you could subscribe to the 
list....) 

    94Dec20 00:30:52 AM From Lab Rat @ The Laboratory, Bellingham Twit Hell
 speaking of calculators... 
  
 I found, in the form of a useless-due-to-incompatibility cdrom to sound board 
wire, a plug capable of fitting onto my serial port on the HP48GX and being 
easily spliced into a handy-dandy 25-pin serial plug I have lying around at 
school. 
 since I'm home, unfortunately, Brent's long-awaited call to my calculator will
have to wait until I get back. 
  
 but I will begin writing messagebase routines immediately. 

    94Dec20 14:22:17 PM From golden spud @ Golden Spud's Greasehouse, @

cjtk> please, PLEASE tell me how to subscribe to the list. 
  
 I'm naive when it comes to mailing lists on the net. 
  
 I really want to impress my friends even more at school! :) 

    94Dec20 15:07:22 PM From Lab Rat @ The Laboratory, Bellingham Twit Hell
 ahh, yes, I bet it could. 
  
 that would be some heavy wizardry. 
  
 you'd have to make a cable interface to plug into TI's idiotic phone-jack 
intercalc transmission system, but it could be done. 
  
 or do they somehow actually enter it into the calculator, with an assembler to
process the source in-calc? 

    94Dec20 00:27:15 AM From darth puppy @ Vert-Beans Online, FERNDALE
Puppycit is also being developed!

what is SpudCit like? 
 and might i aquire a copy of it?
