    A NEW EDITOR COMES TO CITANEWS        
    
 Well, here it is: David A. Quick, Jr. 
(The  Badger)  is relieving  Steve  as 
CitaNews editor.  Steve, now an expert 
at the process (<grin>), has expressed 
a  wish  to  be 'set  free'  from  his 
position.  
 So,  now  that  things  are  changing 
hands,   format,   unfortunately,   is 
changing  also.   Dave happens  to  be 
running  a CP/M Kaypro  and  WordStar.  
BUT,  Dave will reformat anything  you 
send.   So, in any format you'd  like, 
send him your new news at:
     
    The Badger@Pell
               Test System
               KAOS (NY) 
               Aardvark !
               SuperComp II

     We  hope to make this  transition 
an easy one for all concerned.   Until 
later....

      ANOTHER UNIX CITADEL!?!?!?
    Could be.......maybe.....ahem.
--------------------------------------
 Lately,  the Citadel trend has  begun 
to infect the "big boys'" computers  - 
we  can net with UUCP through  STadel, 
there's a VAX/VMS Citadel around  here 
somewhere,  and  now  Unix  itself  is 
being  hit upon as the OS of  Citadel.  
 Peter Clark, a user of the C-86  Test 
System, has ported C-86 into Xenix and 
Unix System V via XUnixadel (??)....in 
a mere six days (so states Mr. Clark).
 The system has not been seen  running 
by  yours truly, so I really  have  no 
comment on style, etc. yet.  But, when 
it  is brought to my attention  in  an 
accessable  format  (North   America), 
CitaNews will be there, on the cutting 
edge   of   telecommunications    with 
style....Citadel.

        CITADEL MODIFICATIONS
      Cheers and Jeers for Ideas
--------------------------------------
 Citadel  is a kludge system  of  code 
put  together by many  programmers  in 
many  forms over many years.   And  it 
continues to change.  Hue, Jr., writer 
of the adaptation C-86, now considered 
pretty   much  standard  Citadel,   is 
constantly  modifying his  code.   And 
yet, the ideas keep coming.
 The  idea of giving the average  user 
the ability to delete his own messages 
has  recently  been  discussed.   This 
would  allow  stupid  mistakes  to  be 
avoided, even after being saved.   sir 
Ector,  on the Test System,  suggested 
also that you must delete the  message 
during that login session.  R.R. feels 
that this leads to lazy writers,  but, 
in  the end, it's all up to  Hue,  Jr. 
anyway....
 As for captain's log, well.....

               OPINIONS
    An Editorial By....The Editor
--------------------------------------
 Well, here's my little bit 'o' gossip 
for the month.  Anything printed  here 
is  the opinion of me alone,  and  any 
quotes will be direct and unabridged.
 It  seems that our beloved  Hue,  Jr. 
feels  that  user Pat  Fish  of  Utica 
College is "a loon again" in the field 
of programming.  You Minnasoteans  are 
just  catching on....we've  felt  that 
way 'bout Pat for YEARS.....:)
 KAOS (Utica, NY) has just made  entry 
into  the net, with the addition of  a 
30  Mb hard drive.  Sysop  Gary  Green 
still    strives    for    signs    of 
excellence....a higher AML and  better 
textfiles......:)
 There's  been  a rumor  going  around 
that Cynbe ru Taren is lurking in  the 
shadows of the net somewhere....if  he 
catches this, we here at the  CitaNews 
editing  desk would like him  to  know 
he's  always got a home in our  hearts 
and minds.....:)
 Well, that's all the gossip for  this 
month.   Have  a  little  tidbit  that 
would  make us laugh, or give us  even 
the  SLIGHTEST shred of  information??  
Submit   an  article  or  message   to 
CitaNews  Control.   We'll  DEFINITELY 
print it!!
--------------------------------------
         !! CONTEST ALERT !!
       CitaNews' First Contest
--------------------------------------
 Well,  with  a new editor  comes  new 
features.   And,  one  of  them  is  a 
contest section.  Each month, I'll  be 
holding a contest of different  sorts, 
and  the winner will win  some  paltry 
prize of some sort or another.

 So,  contest #1 begins.  The form  is 
that  of  a  math  problem.   And  the 
question is....
 
If  you take the number of  CHARACTERS 
in  the  name  of  the  alias  of  the 
original   author   of   Citadel   and 
multiply  it by the number of  LETTERS 
in the name of the Citadel written  in 
Turbo Pascal by Hue, Sr., what is  the 
answer, in HEX??
 
Send your answers to me, at any of the 
addresses  at  the  beginning  of  the 
letter, or send them via U.S. Mail to:

         David A. Quick, Jr.
              Box 191-C
      Stittville, NY 13469-0191

I'll  be  sure  to  write  back,   and 
multiple   correct  answers  will   be 
decided  by  a  random  drawing.   The 
prize  of the month is 10 blank  DS/DD 
5.25" floppies, so enter soon!!
--------------------------------------
              COMMENTS??
            Let me know!!
--------------------------------------
 Would  you  like  to  see   something 
specific in CitaNews??  Would you like 
something taken out??  Would you  like 
to     HELP?!?!?!?!?!??       (Foriegn 
correspondents  are  SO hard  to  find 
these  days....heh)   Just drop  me  a 
line.    Buffers,   notes,   articles, 
messages,  anything that you thing  is 
pretty cool, give it to me.  I'll sort 
out anything I can use.  BUT, I  can't 
sort  if you don't send.   So  please, 
help   a  16-year-old   with   graying 
hair....
