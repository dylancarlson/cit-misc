 STADEL VERSION 3.1
 ***********************************************************

	STadel, orc's Atari ST version of Citadel, has gone
to version 3.1 with a number of major improvements. We've been
beta-testing it at the Lake, and we're quite happy with the
changes. 

	The most obvious is "floors" -- an enhancement to the
room structure that allows a sysop to associate related rooms.
For example, a "Tech stuff" floor might include rooms devoted to
Modula-2, C, BASIC and Pascal rooms; a "Literature" floor might
include Shakespeare, Stephen King and Weekly World News.

	A user's configuration can be set to either "see" or
ignore the floors. In the latter case, the system looks like any
"normal" Citadel. In "floor mode," the [K]nown Rooms command
operates only on the current floor.

	If you think of moving through Citadel rooms as going in
a great circle, you might think of STadel's floor mode as a
series of smaller circles. The first room on each floor functions
somewhat like a lobby; when you've visited all the rooms on a
given floor, you return to the first. The next [G]oto command
pops you into the next floor where rooms have unread messages.

	There also are new commands for moving directly among
floors, listing known floors, etc. Floor-related commands are
prefixed with a ! or a ; (as in !Known floors or ;Known floors).
You also can use > and <, which "skip" to the next or previous
floor.

	Other enhancements:

	MULTINET: Multiple networking sessions can be set
up. This would allow, for instance, a "local net" timeframe
and a separate "interstate net" session.

	ALLNET AND AUTONET: A sysop can choose to enable
net privileges for all users, instead of having to toggle
the authority for each user. A related enhancement makes
all messages in a room automatically net-messages.

	CALLING OUT: In the [T]elephone call command from
the sysop menu, if you type '?', you will be given a list
of systems on the net.

	DROPPED DTR: When a sysop ESCapes into console mode,
STadel drops DTR. This keeps the modem from answering the
telephone if anyone calls while the sysop is logged in.  

	FASTER MODEMS: 9600 baud support is in.

	FILE TRANSFERS: New protocols include Ymodem, Ymodem
Batch for downloads and "Vanilla" ASCII for file transfers. 

	INVITED USERS: A command to let the sysop check to
see who has been invited to an invitation-only room.

	LONG DISTANCE: L-D roomsharing routing.

	MISCELLANEOUS: If you type ^T from the console, STadel
will hang up the phone as soon as the current user logs off and
beep at you for a minute, then reconnect the phone and go about
its normal business. If you type ^P from the console, STadel
will give you a status line listing who's logged in, what time
it is, the phase of the moon, and many other useless features. 

	UUCP INTERFACE: We described the plans for a UUCP
interface in a previous issue, but here's a synopsis:

	 UUCP is a Unix-to-Unix copy program that lets systems
running that operating system transfer files and mail
automatically. UUCP and similar programs for other
mini/mainframe operating systems have been used to build a
number of "wide area networks" such as Usenet, ARPAnet, Bitnet,
CSnet, etc. If you're affiliated with a university or company
"hooked into" such a net, you can get/send mail, including
public discussions, and even electronic "magazines." These nets
stretch across the United States and into several foreign
countries.

	Orc has built a companion program to STadel called UUCALL
that contacts a Usenet node (with permission) and pretends to be
a satellite Unix system, sending and receiving mail. The mail
then is integrated with the Citadel database. Thus a user with
the proper permission and credits can send mail from a Citadel
node through Usenet to an ARPAnet gateway to a researcher at SRI,
or receive the latest Atari technical news by "subscribing" to
the comp.sys.atari digest.

	In order to participate in such a transfer, an STadel
sysop will need experience with UUCP and a good relationship
with the operator of a registered network node.

	Converting to STadel 3.1 requires a program that
restructures the data files, plus a number of revisions to the
ctdlcnfg.sys file including changes in the way networking is
described. 

	"OK," you say. "How do I get this nifty new program?"

	The most foolproof and probably cheapest way is to send
a couple of disks and a self-addressed, stamped envelope (or
$5.00 and orc will buy the disks and the envelope) to:

    David Parsons (orc)
    2624 Bryant Ave S #2
    Minneapolis, Minn 55408

	STadel is no longer available for downloading from Pell,
but you can contact orc there (US 612-377-9239).

	By the way, orc has not solicited any payment for his
work with STadel, but he probably would not object to a check,
gold bullion or blonde in a red convertible delivered to the
above address. :-) 


 ***********************************************************
 INNER SANCTUM STILL BETA-TESTING  
 ***********************************************************

	Inner Sanctum for the Atari ST has been "almost ready"
for public release for a month or so, but at last word it was
still being beta-tested. It also seemed to be mutating quite
rapidly away from Citadel and along lines more familiar to
Stonehenge users.

	Inner Sanctum began with the STadel source code, most of
which was converted from Alcyon to Mark Williams C by Ganelius
of Seattle. Networking has not been implemented. The system 
began to gain a number of distinctly non-Citadel features, the
most prominent of which was on-line games using the Dave Betz
ADVSYS adventure-authoring system. (Dave Betz is a senior editor
of BIX, the electronic affiliate of Byte Magazine, and ADVSYS
was profiled in the May 1987 issue of Byte.)

	IS also gained "prompted" reading, similar to the .Read
More option of STadel, except that it was redefined as the
default. A "To:" field was added to the message header. Both of
these features violate what is regarded as "Citadel design
philosophy" in many circles; they are features that commonly are
requested by users who are not familiar with Citadel.

	By executing external programs, IS supports WXmodem,
Ymodem and "kamikaze" Xmodem in which the sender doesn't wait
for an ACK, and aborts if a single NAK is received. The enhanced
protocols, added with the help of Thomas Zerucha of Southfield,
Mich., are intended to overcome the delays inherent in
packet-switched networks such as Telenet's PC Pursuit.

	We chatted recently with Cheech Wizard of Dream Park BBS
in California (US 916-638-4237), who is among several sysops
beta-testing version 1.20 of IS. He reported that the adventure
module has been deactivated pending the installation of "doors"
as a method of running outside programs. Meanwhile, "hallways"
and a .Read Userlog option have been added.

	Hallways are quite different from floors; they connect
rooms in multiple dimensions. A room can exist on multiple
hallways (you can imagine it as an intersection), but [G]oto and
[K]nown rooms will function only along the hallway you're
currently using.

	Depending on how a sysop arranges the halls, IS has a
potential to be quite confusing.  We noticed messages in some of
the rooms at Dream Park that complained of difficulty in finding
some of the rooms.


 ************************************************************
 CITABOOK, "ROOMS WITH UNREAD MESSAGES"
 ************************************************************

	Lazarus Long (Kevin McLeod) of Minneapolis has been
capturing discussions from Twin Cities Citadels for several
years in the hopes of eventually assembling a book showing the
best of what electronic communication can be.

	In the following message, he describes the status of this
monumental project.

   87Aug29 9:20 pm from Lazarus Long to George Jetson

	Over two years in the making, "Rooms With Unread
Messages" is rapidly nearing completion. The so-called
"Citabook" will be the first to chronicle the discussions and
witticisms conducted on Minnesota Citadels.

	Chapter one, "In Loco Parentis," features a passionate
debate on the role of respect between a father and his teenage
son. Subsequent chapters explore alternative forms of marriage,
an eloborate hoax involving a phony BBS and a sorority, and the
best way to wash (or eliminate) dishes. You can walk the streets
of Berlin with Doug Bailey and eat lunch with C.J. Anderson.

	At this writing seven chapters, over 152 pages are ready
to be laserprinted and submitted to potential agents and
publishers.

	Although the project was stalled for some time by file
conversion problems, these obstacles have been cleared and
remaining chapters will soon be concluded.

	"Rooms With Unread Messages" will be dedicated to the
late Joe Summers, who was a prominent member of the Twin Cities
Citadel community.


 ***********************************************************
 ACROPOLIS, A TURBO PASCAL CITACLONE
 ***********************************************************

	Borland's Turbo Pascal has not only been a smash hit in
the world of software publishing, it has resulted in two Citadel
workalikes. Robert Becquette provided this description of
Acropolis. (DYM in this message refers to Dial-Your-Match).

   87Jul29 6:10 am from Robert Bequette

	Well, I just finally got copies of the CitaNews.  I had
no idea of the network of Citadels and its "mutant" children.
Since it was asked for in one of them I am here to tell about my
particular "mutant": Acropolis.

	I guess I should start with a little history: 

	The following is not meant to offend anyone, if it does
I'm sorry, but it is an important part of the history of
Acropolis. 

	It started out last September  as a question to me from
another man (Will Bennett) on one of the local DYM's asking if I
knew of any BBS for gays in Sacramento.  I replied that there
were none and then the conversation evolved into a discussion of
the need for one and the general shortcomings of DYM.  It
started out with Will supplying the hardware and me writing a
custom BBS for it.

	Since I have been a fan of Citadel since first running
into them about two years ago, it was natural for me to select
it as the format of choice.  And on November 1, 1986 Acropolis,
Sacramento's first and only BBS dedicated to the interests of
gay and bisexual men, was up and running. As for one supplying
the hardware and the other software, it no longer matters since
on Acropolis's first month anniversary Will and I moved in
together.  For those of you wondering where the name Acropolis
comes from it means "A Greek Citadel" (there is a joke in there
somewhere). 

	Ok, enough of that.  The current incarnation of
Acropolis (version 1.8) is essentially Citadel (the original)
with extensive matchmaking capabilities; the current
questionnaire (with 214 different test points!) is tailored to
gay males but can easily be reworded to match all combinations.
The only things missing are XModem transfers and the <.R>ead
<G>lobol-New commands, both of which are being included in the
first complete rewrite christened "version 2.0".  In addison to
matchmaking, several other things have been in 1.8 or are being
added to 2.0:

	Multiple user levels being extended from four to eight.

	<.R>ead <L>ocate <N>ew/<F>orward which search messages
for a string. 

	Users can delete their private mail. 

	"Random" mail a message to someone, but you're not told
who.  

	All the sysop functions are being moved into the
BBS itself. 

	There are several new sysop functions including: Setting
the function keys, undeleting an account, controlling a user's
access to the board (time limit and so on), doing a password
dump and so on. 

	Several new type of room options: Auto-record message in
a text file.  Disclaimer message printed on entry to a room.  A
Sysop+> room like the Aide*> room; Sysop room is to Aides like
private rooms are to regular users. Chats are automatically
recorded to a text file. The only change to the Aide commands is
that they no longer have the ability to delete accounts but they
will be able to suspend access to it. 

	There are lots of other little things, but then this
message would be much too long.

	Acropolis is currently running 24 hours a days with a 4
Meg message base (we get A LOT of private mail), and about 150
active (call at least once every three weeks) callers, 64 rooms
(going to 128). The phone number is (916) 967-5817.

	System configuration: IBM PC/AT clone, 30 Meg hard
drive, 1.2 Meg floppy, 3.5" 720K floppy, Hayes Smartmodem 2400b.

	Version 1.8 and below will not be released into public
domain, but 2.0 and up will be released in two versions: one
with and one without matchmaking.  Release will be in both
executable and Turbo Pascal source.

	What's in the future? 2.1 will support multi-user (under
plain vanilla PC-DOS), and after that hopefully networking.
Plains are also under way to port it over to the Macintosh and
Amiga.  -- Robert Bequette

 CITADEL-86 TESTS VERSION 3 FEATURES
 ***********************************************************

	Citadel-86, for PC clones and Z-100s from Hue, Jr. of
Minnesota, isn't standing still. As we reported in a previous
issue, it has been converted to Borland's Turbo C and has
suffered from some difficulties with bugs in Turbo (such as an
apparent refusal on the part of the compiler to flush file
buffers), but Hue's work has not been limited to bug-squishing.
The following report, edited from a message Hue, Jr. posted in
the networked CitaNews room, outlines the latest enhancements.

   87Aug24 11:07 pm from Hue, Jr. @  C-86 Test System

   C-86 just keeps slowly slogging it's way towards V3.  The
features of V3 implemented and being tested here and at
Illusions are: 

 o Enable/disable modem when sysop is on.  When sysop hits ESC
when there is no carrier, the modem will be disabled, and will
only be re-enabled for chat, dialout, and putting the system
back in MODEM mode. 

 o Killed a kludge that made V2.17 very slow to load if it was a
networking system. 

 o Formally put the autobaud via modem result codes into
CTDLCNFG.SYS.  Eric Brown @Primordial Ooze has graciously agreed
to take a look at modifying the Z-100 modem handler so that
Z-100s, in conjunction with a minor h/w mod, can also read modem
result codes. 

 o Consolidated NET_RECEPT_DIR and NET_RECEPT_DISK into
NET_RECEPT_AREA, which makes it a lot more reasonable to
comprehend. 

 o The #event stuff is in and working, although I think there is
a very minor problem with it on a rollover point.. 

 o Multi-net handling is now in and working. 

 o (Most recent) The
catch-interrupted-message-on-carrier-loss-for-later-finishing
feature.  If you're composing a message, and lose carrier
(call-waiting, meddlesome cats, etc.), C-86 will grab that
half-finished message and save it for the next time you login,
so you can finish it. (Anyone interested in trying to name this
feature?) 

  Hmmmmm.  Anyone with a 9600 baud modem out there care to tell
me if 4800 is normally supported on a 9600 baud modem? While I
can't test it, it should be easy to put in 9600 support -- but
should I put in 4800 support while I'm at it, then? 

	(Hue said in a later message that he plans to include
4800 support.)

 CITADEL HELPS JEFFERSON SOFTWARE SUPPORT MODULA-2
 ************************************************************

	Jefferson Software of Phoenix, Ariz., has set up a BBS
running STadel as a support forum for its JS Modula-2
programming language compiler. Kbad @ Phase BBS reports that the
company, would like to establish a support network of Citadel
systems sharing a Modula-2 room via PC Pursuit. A side benefit
would be free updates to JS Modula for participating sysops, and
entry into the registered user discount, in which registered
users can purchase additional copies of JS Modula for 40% off
list price, and can pass the savings on to their buddies, or
make a few bucks for their trouble. 

	Anyone who's interested in any of the above can contact
JS BBS (US 602-276-6102.)

	We asked Gary at Jefferson Software to provide a blurb
explaining JS Modula-2, a remarkably low-priced compiler for the
Atari ST. Here's his info:

               Jefferson Software
          Modula 2 Development System

 Call for COD or credit card. Dealer inquiries welcome.

	Jefferson Software is trying something different with JS
Modula. We do not charge a lot for updates, they are currently
free. We get our users involved with what goes into the system,
and help the ones that are learning as much as possable. We are
using Citadel on our support bbs. The ideas designed into
Citadel are ones we like. People can use the bbs to communicate
about Modula, and we do have a few other rooms to have
conversation on other topics. We think the bbs is a big help in
making JS Modula more than another development system.

	We would like to net a JS Modula support room. We are PC
Pursuitable. Anyone interested contact JS BBS at US 602 276
6102.

 CITADEL-64 GOES SHAREWARE
 ***********************************************************

	Citadel-64, a commercial BBS system for the
Commodore 64 that is based on Citadel but implemented in
BASIC and machine language, has been released as a
shareware product. Previously it was available only by
prepayment.

	Since the announcement (below) from K2NE Software,
CitaNews has received a number of reports from prospective
sysops who have been unable to get the program to run. Vince
Quaresima of Jersey Devil Citadel advises that the problem
is with the ARC packing method, and that all ARC'd versions
should be destroyed. An alternate package packed by the LYNX
program should work, or a ready-to-run disk can be obtained
by purchase from K2NE.

  87Jul19 6:55 am from Vince Quaresima 
  To: All C64 BBS Sysops (and potential Sysops)  
  Fr: K2NE Software  
  Re: Citadel-64  
  On: 87Jul18  

	K2NE Software is pleased to announce the impending
release of CITADEL-64 into the FREEware domain! 

	In order to make this a worthwhile project for the
C64 BBS Sysops and users, the Citadel-64 system has been
specifically "patched" for the Commodore 1670 Modem-1200.
In addition, sections of the original code have been
re-designed and re-written in order to maximize speed and
to support operation at a REAL 1200 bps, unlike most C64
systems, which are closer to an 800bps thruput rate.  

	For those unfamiliar with Citadel-64, it features
most of what you have become accustomed to finding on a
Citadel-style bulletin board.  Naturally, the hardware
restrictions imposed by the C64 environment prevent a
"full-blown" implementation, but we feel you will like what
we have to offer to you, and certainly, the price is
"right".

	In keeping with FREEware practice, we are ONLY
asking that you send a donation (no more than $15) IF you
like it and USE it.  Feel free to swap it around to your
friends, and to upload it to other bulletin board systems.
The complete Citadel-64 package, in ARC'ed format, will
begin appearing on the following systems approximately July
24, 1987:

	a) Jersey Devil Citadel 609-726-1565 
	b) Galactic Keep 609-654-7468 
	c) Morningstar Keep 609-268-9597 
	d) Bit Bucket Citadel 609-888-4811
	e) Pinelands BBS 609-859-1910
	f) The Labyrinth Citadel 609-893-0497

	In addition, the package will be uploaded to the
CBMPRG SIG of CompuServe, where it will be available for
downloading using either XMODEM or the CompuServe B
Protocol. 

	If you prefer to obtain yours as a "turn-key"
system, with a "ready-to-run" boot-disk, please send your
$15.00 donation to: K2NE Software PO Box 289 Chatsworth, NJ
08019

	Remember, FREEware is NOT "public domain".  You
can swap it, or you can use it, but you can NOT sell it
(other than for a minimal copy-fee to cover disk/postage).
That is the Law! 

 ***********************************************************
 FCC "INFORMATION TAX" STILL ALIVE
 ***********************************************************

	Contrary to information from the publication
"Bulletin Board Systems" that was quoted in the last issue
of CitaNews, the Federal Communications Commission is still
considering a proposal to slap a steep (about $5 per hour)
"access fee" on interstate computer network connections
with local telephone systems.

	This so-called "information tax" would directly
affect PC Pursuit, CompuServe, the Source, GEnie, Delphi,
Dow Jones News/Retrieval and similar systems, including
anything connected with Telenet or Tymnet.

	The effect of this proposal on local bulletin board
systems may not be obvious, but it is substantial. Most of
the public-domain software you obtain from your local BBS
was relayed across the country through the major networks.
PC Pursuit, which allows many BBS users to call
cross-country for a low monthly fee, would be just about
wiped out.

	Sy Borg of Images at Twilight in Bloomington, MN,
relays the following data from PC Pursuit:

	87Aug21 4:02 pm from Sy Borg@Images
  
  	Dear Pc Enthusiast: 

	Six weeks ago we wrote to many of you about the
Federal Communications Commisions' (FCC) proposal to extend
carrier access charges to Telenet and other enhanced
service providers.  In that letter, and in subsequent
conversations with many of you, we promised to provide
additional information when the FCC published its official
notice - which occured on JULY 17. 

	We have enclosed for you (1) a copy of the FCC's
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) and (2) a paper that
both analyzes the NPRM as it affects PC users and suggests
steps that you can take to help defeat the access charge
proposal, thus ensuring the continued availability of
low-cost information and data communications services. 

	Access charges would affect all interstate data
communications utilizing local dial access to reach a
public on-line computer service, e.g., a database or
electronic mail service, home banking/shopping service or
videotext service.  Access charges would also apply to
services like PC Pursuit, provided by a value-added network
(VAN) like Telenet, that utilize local dial access. 

	These charges would add approximately $4.50 per
hour to the cost of connections reaching involving only
dial-in access (e.g. a PC dialing into the Telenet network
to reach a database host), and would add approximately $7
to $9 per hour to the cost of connections involving both
dial-in and dial-out access (such as PC Pursuit involving
PC-to-PC communications).  Further, unlike most
communications prices, access charges have no discounts for
evening and weekend hours.  Services currently priced at a
flat monthly rate would have to be repriced on a n hourly
basis under current access charges. 

	For those of you who are current PC Pursuit
subscribers, access charges would require Telenet to
increase its prices (currently, a flat monthly rate of $25)
to reflect the $7 or $9 per-hour access charge.  Of course,
we expect that significantly higher prices would dampen
demand for the service, so it is not clear whether Telenet
could continue to make Pc Pursuit available even for those
users willing to pay the higher price.  

	PC users who subscribe to database services such as
The Source, Compuserve, or Quantum would incur access
charges on those services of approximately $4.50 per hour,
effectively doubling the current rate for some services. 

	This need not occur:  We can defeat the proposal
with your help.  By writing a letter to the chairman of the
FCC and sending copies to the other Commissioners, the
Secretary, the Chief of the Common Carrier Bureau, and your
Congressional representatives, you can affect the outcome
of this issue.  Both the FCC and the Congress are receptive
to your input.  Moreover, they need to hear from you in
order to assess the impact of this proposal.  

	Your letter should emphasize how access charges
would affect you.  Tell the FCC, what database, Bulletin
Board, or data communications services you use today and
for what purposes, what you monthly usage level is, what
you pay now, and how access charges (at approximately
$4.540 per hour of use for database host access, and twice
that for Pc Pursuit) would impact your use of these
services. 

	Our analysis paper includes the names and addresses
of the relevent parties to whom you can write.  As
indicated above, it is perfectly acceptable for you to
write one letter to the Chairman of the Federal
Communications Commission and to copy all other parties.
Names and addresses of U.S. senators are included here.
Telenet would appreciate having a blind copy of your letter
for use in our lobbying efforts, and we have enclosed a
business reply envelope for your convenience in sending us
one.  

	Please note that the FCC has EXTENDED the due dates for
comments and reply comments in this proceeding to SEPTEMBER 24
and OCTOBER 26 respectively.  You need not wait for this date,
however; your letter can be sent immediately.  

	The access charge proposal would greatly increase
the cost of on-line computing and information services,
hitting users of low-cost services (especially in the home
and educational markets) especially hard.  Development of
the market for such low-cost services would be stifled,
depriving U.S.  consumers of affordable information
services.  In addition, access charges would have a
devastating effect on the Bulletin Board System (BBS)
community due to the cost-increase by acccess charges. 

	Letters should be addressed to the Honorable Dennis
Patrick, Federal Communications Commission, Washington DC
20554, with copies to the Secretary, Mr. William J.
Tricarico; the Chief, Common Carrier Bureau, Mr. Gerald
Brock, and to each of the other three commissioners: 

	Commissioner James Quello 
	Commissioner Mimi Weyforth Dawson 
	Commissioner Patricia Diaz Dennis 

	On the letter, indicate "RE: CC Docket 87-215" 

	In addition, we strongly recommend that you send
copies of your comments and replies and / or any
correspondence to the FCC on this matter to your
congressman, your two senators, and the Chairmen of the
House and Senate Telecommunications Subcommittees.  (The
names and addresses of your Congressional representatives
can be obtained from your local library), chamber of
commerce, or your local democratic or republican
headquarters.) A cover letter should be attached, stressing
the importance of the issue and asking the member of
congress to express his / her concerns to the FCC.  The
subcommittee chairmen are: 

  
   The Honorable Edward J. Markey, Chairman 
   Subcommittee on Telecommuncations and Finance 
   Committee of Energy and Commerce 
   U.S. House of Representatives 
   Washington, DC 20515 
  
   The Honorable Daniel K. Inouye, Chairman 
   Subcommittee on Telecommunications 
   Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation 
   U.S. Senate 
   Washington, D.C. 20510 
  
   Please also forward a copy to Telenet's Regulatory Affairs Dept. 
   12490 Sunrise Valley Drive 
   Reston, VA 22096 
   So that we will be aware of it in our lobbying efforts. 

	Interested parties may discuss the issues in this
docket with the FCC Commissioners and staff at any time
prior to the FCC's issuance of a "Sunshine Notice" that it
plans to consider the matter at it's next public meeting --
which will probably occur sometime in November and
December.  It is perfectly appropriate to contact the FCC
now if you have any questions about the matter, but
meetings and telephone calls for the purpose of lobbying
your views are generally most effective after the two
rounds of written comments are completed -- i.e. after
October 26th. 

	If you choose to follow-up your letter with a
telephone call, such contacts should be focused on the four
commissioners, the Common Carrier Bureau Chief, and the
Chief of the Bureau's Policy Division.  Their phone numbers
are: 

  
   Chairman Dennis Patrick:  202-632-6600 
   Commissioner James Quello 202-632-7557 
   Commissioner Mimi Dawson  202-632-6446 
   Commissioner Patricia Dennis 202-632-6996 
   Gerald Brock, Chief, Common Carrier Bureau 202-632-6910 
   Thomas Sugrue, Policy Division, Common Carrier Bureau 202-632-9342

 THE LAKE IS GOING DOWN
 ***********************************************************

	Sad to say, The Lake, home of CitaNews, is going down.
Running STadel has been fun and instructive, but there are 
demands on a sysop's time and money other than BBSing, and it
would nice to have easy access to one's own computer when the
wife wants to play Wheel of Fortune or the Lake's official yard
monster wants to play Winnie the Pooh in the Hundred Acre Wood.

	We promise that the Lake will return immediately when we
win the Publisher's Clearing House Sweepstakes, which voluminous
mail assures us we "may already have won."

	We'll keep the STadel software, and if you run a
C86-compatible networking system, you may get an occasional
surprise network file transfer from CitaNews Central.

	CitaNews will continue to be published monthly, more or
less, so long as there's sufficient interest and participation.
We'll gather info by personal contacts, through the networked
CitaNews room, and through both electronic and postal mail. Among
the systems carrying the CitaNews room is Citadel-86 Test System,
US 612-866-1804, where you can leave a message or private mail to
George Jetson.

	Or you can send a letter or disk to:
	Steve Yelvington
	1392 Brandlwood Road
	White Bear Lake, MN 55110

	(We can read MS-DOS 5.25 floppies, IBM PS/2 3.5 disks or
Atari ST-formatted single-sided 3.5 disks.)
