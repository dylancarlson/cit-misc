 The file "HISTORY" has all changes I made to ACit, and also all of the
changes I was planning to make (at the time, anyway).  I=internal, E=external.
 
 
 The file "CHANGES.TXT" has major changes made to GremCit (now called
Citadel+).
  bb=Brent Bottles (resident)
  eh=Don Kimberlin (err head)
  ep=Elisabeth Perrin (Livia)
  mp=Matthew Pfleger (The Gremlin)  
  rg=Richard Finegold (Richard Goldfinder)
 Current release is 64.2, which goes up to line 558 (and also end paragraphs).
Oh, and btw, GremCit is now mostly C++.  There are classes for the main
objects (messages, rooms, halls, groups, users).  It's quite arguably the
most configurable Citadel, both from a user point of view (type .EC on
my system) and a sysop point of view (over 160 parameters just in CONFIG.CIT,
most with defaults).
  
 
 The file "REMINISC" has excerpts from a couple of rooms on my BBS (The Raft).
All messages are still there in the Citadel Q & A and BBS History rooms,
if you want more context.  I've added extra linefeeds between messages for
easier reading.
 
 
 Oh, also: in that Citadel Family Tree, a couple of lines should be
added in the "lost" section:
  | Titan           , Atari 800  , BASICXE, The Dragon                 |
  | Titanic         , Atari 800XL, BASICXE, Richard Goldfinder         |
 I forgot to credit myself when I incorporated the East Coast tree.
 
 
 Feel free to redistribute these files.
