Here are some issues of Citanews ("The national newsletter about room-based BBS systems"). I do not know if there are
more out there. I have never followed Citanews, and haven't even read these files myself.

<p>And one issue of CitaHell, which proclaimed itself as "The Underground News Source for Citadel and its variants!" I've
never even heard of this one until just now (September 19, 1999). I don't know if there are other issues of this around, and haven't read it, either.
